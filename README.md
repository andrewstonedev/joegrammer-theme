# Exa Theme Pack

*What Exa theme pack offers*

A set of great looking themes created for eye comfort and consistent semantic highling rules.

**Eye Comfort** & **Consistency**

The themes were created with [WCAG - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) in mind to provide a minumum level of *AA* contrast (>6.0 contrast ratio) for syntax highlighting and UI text components, reducing eye-strain.

What does consistency mean for syntax highlighting and UI? I wanted to maintain a consistent visual reference regardless of the theme by using consistent hues across themes for syntax ruling.

4 themes created with the purpose of accomidating lighting conditions throughout the day:
- Glacial (light)
  - Higher contrast, made to accomidate bright ambient light and cut through screen glare
- Azure Dawn (med blue theme)
  - Created to accomidate less intense lighting conditions
- Tundra Dusk (dark blue theme)
  - Created to accomidate use in dimmer light conditions

"Bonus" theme - Woodland Eventide (foresty-green theme)
