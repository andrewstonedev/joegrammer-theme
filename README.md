# Exa Theme Pack

*What Exa theme pack offers*

A set of great looking themes created for eye comfort and consistent semantic highling rules.

**Eye Comfort** & **Consistency**

The themes were created with [WCAG - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) in mind to provide a minumum level of *AA* contrast (>6.0 contrast ratio) for syntax highlighting and UI text components, reducing eye-strain.

What does consistency mean for syntax highlighting and UI? I wanted a consistent visual reference regardless of the theme by using consistent hues across themes for syntax ruling.
